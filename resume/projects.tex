	{3D Reconstruction of satellite using Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields}
	{\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09060}{[Publication]}}
	{}
	{Applied \emph{instant-ngp} and \emph{D-NeRF} for efficient 3D model reconstruction of satellite from a single view camera video of the real satellite object, enabling improved space debris removal and on-orbit servicing.}

	\cventry
	{}
	{Temporal-Spatial Transformer in Soft Actor-Critic/TD3 for autonomous driving}
	{\href{https://github.com/sesem738/Lavenza}{[Project link]}}
	{}
	{Implemented a transformer module and action-memory within Soft Actor-Critic and TD3 architectures, enabling the agent to "remember" its previous actions and effectively predict the next ones. Tested on \emph{highway-env}, an OpenAI Gym environment for autonomous driving decision-making tasks}

	\cventry
	{}
	{GPU-supported PySpark Notebook with DeltaLake}
	{\href{https://github.com/n0k0m3/pyspark-notebook-deltalake-docker}{[Repo link]}}
	{}
	{Docker container for data analysis with Jupyter notebook server, RAPIDS AI, PySpark for GPU-accelerated, distributed and scalable ETL, aiming for feature parity with Databricks - a popular cloud-based data analytics platform.}

	\cventry
	{}
	{Persistent Homology feature engineering on Handwritten Digits and Letters}
	{\href{https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18z161k3diYO6sNVBfiKH8uGqbrekxMPN?usp=sharing}{[Project link]}}
	{}
	{Apply Persistent Homology, a topological data analysis technique for feature engineering, using \emph{giotto-ai}, on extended MNIST dataset, achieving 91\% testing accuracy with a non-convolutional feedforward neural network in \emph{Keras/TensorFlow}.}
