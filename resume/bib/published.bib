  abstract       = {We revisit our earlier paper, with two of the coauthors, in which we proposed an unbiased and consistent estimator &mu;^n for an unknown mutation rate &mu; of microorganisms. Previously, we proved that the associated sequence of estimators &mu;^n converges to &mu; almost surely pointwise on a nonextinct set &Omega;0. Here, we show that this sequence converges also in the mean square with respect to conditional probability measure P0&middot;=P&middot;&cap;&Omega;0/P&Omega;0 and that, with respect to P0, the estimator is asymptotically unbiased. We further assume that a microorganism can mutate or turn to a different variant of one of the two types. In particular, it can mean that bacteria under attack by a virus or chemical agent are either perishing or surviving, turning them to stronger variant. We propose estimators for their respective types and show that they are a.s. pointwise and L2-consistent and asymptotically unbiased with respect to measure P0.},
