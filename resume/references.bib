	abstract     = {We revisit our earlier paper, with two of the coauthors, in which we proposed an unbiased and consistent estimator &mu;^n for an unknown mutation rate &mu; of microorganisms. Previously, we proved that the associated sequence of estimators &mu;^n converges to &mu; almost surely pointwise on a nonextinct set &Omega;0. Here, we show that this sequence converges also in the mean square with respect to conditional probability measure P0&middot;=P&middot;&cap;&Omega;0/P&Omega;0 and that, with respect to P0, the estimator is asymptotically unbiased. We further assume that a microorganism can mutate or turn to a different variant of one of the two types. In particular, it can mean that bacteria under attack by a virus or chemical agent are either perishing or surviving, turning them to stronger variant. We propose estimators for their respective types and show that they are a.s. pointwise and L2-consistent and asymptotically unbiased with respect to measure P0.}

	abstract     = {This research investigates the potential application of generative language models, especially ChatGPT, in aviation safety analysis as a means to enhance the efficiency of safety analyses and accelerate the time it takes to process incident reports. In particular, ChatGPT was leveraged to generate incident synopses from narratives, which were subsequently compared with ground-truth synopses from the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) dataset. The comparison was facilitated by using embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs), with aeroBERT demonstrating the highest similarity due to its aerospace-specific fine-tuning. A positive correlation was observed between the synopsis length and its cosine similarity. In a subsequent phase, human factors issues involved in incidents, as identified by ChatGPT, were compared to human factors issues identified by safety analysts. The precision was found to be 0.61, with ChatGPT demonstrating a cautious approach toward attributing human factors issues. Finally, the model was utilized to execute an evaluation of accountability. As no dedicated ground-truth column existed for this task, a manual evaluation was conducted to compare the quality of outputs provided by ChatGPT to the ground truths provided by safety analysts. This study discusses the advantages and pitfalls of generative language models in the context of aviation safety analysis and proposes a human-in-the-loop system to ensure responsible and effective utilization of such models, leading to continuous improvement and fostering a collaborative approach in the aviation safety domain.}

	abstract     = {The accelerating deployment of spacecraft in orbit has generated interest in on-orbit servicing (OOS), inspection of spacecraft, and active debris removal (ADR). Such missions require precise rendezvous and proximity operations in the vicinity of non-cooperative, possibly unknown, resident space objects. Safety concerns with manned missions and lag times with ground-based control necessitate complete autonomy. This requires robust characterization of the targetâ€™s geometry. In this article, we present an approach for mapping geometries of satellites on orbit based on 3D Gaussian splatting that can run on computing resources available on current spaceflight hardware. We demonstrate model training and 3D rendering performance on a hardware-in-the-loop satellite mock-up under several realistic lighting and motion conditions. Our model is shown to be capable of training on-board and rendering higher quality novel views of an unknown satellite nearly 2 orders of magnitude faster than previous NeRF-based algorithms. Such on-board capabilities are critical to enable downstream machine intelligence tasks necessary for autonomous guidance, navigation, and control tasks.}
