	{Seattle, WA}
	{Jan 2022 - May 2022}
	{\begin{cvitems}
			\item {Developed and deployed scalable Named Entity Recognition (NER) pipelines for clinical notes information extraction and de-identification using John Snow Labs' SparkNLP free model and a custom PyTorch model}
			\item {Analyzed cloud infrastructure costs and optimized potential savings by calculating cluster size, resulting in \$2M annual savings and a 75\% reduction in operating costs}
			\item {Conducted threat modeling using OWASP Threat Dragon and recommended mitigation strategies for pipeline deployment}
			\item {Created a clinical notes annotation tool prototype based on Label Studio and INCEpTION for internal use}
			\item {Navigated complex organizational processes and collaborated with multiple stakeholders to ensure timely access to resources and maintain project momentum}

	{May 2021 - Aug 2021}
	{\begin{cvitems}
			\item {Developed a data quality measurement toolkit using Spark for the Truveta Health Data Model (THDM), which assessed data completeness, conformance to THDM, and plausibility based on OHDSI criteria}
			\item {The toolkit garnered trust from participating health providers, leading to multiple partnerships with new healthcare providers, a collaboration with Microsoft, and integration into Truveta Studio, Truveta's first product}
			\item {Established the foundational approach and model for Synthetic Patient Health Data, leveraging probabilistic theory of document retrieval, representation learning, and deep learning, with applications in generating synthetic health data, filling missing patient data, and predicting doctor-patient encounters and diagnoses/medications from health history}
			\item {Designed and implemented a synthetic patient data model using Monte Carlo sampling for stress-testing and bottleneck identification in the ETL process, capable of generating millions of records in 1 hour, ensuring robust data ingestion and querying systems}
			\item {Developed an annotation recommender system for medical concept normalization, reducing annotators' workload by 80\%}
			\item {Deployed and integrated the data quality measurement toolkit into the data ingestion pipeline using Azure DevOps Pipelines, leveraging Azure resources such as Databricks, Azure VM, Storage Blob, and Data Factory (ADF)}
