	{\begin{cvitems}
			\item {Developed an ETL pipeline to measure data quality of Truveta Health Data Model, which is now part of Truveta Studio, the first Truveta's product.}
			% garnering trusts from health providers. Contributed to new partnerships with multiple after Private Review in Aug 2021, and with Microsoft in Sept 2021.}
			\item {Designed a synthetic patient data model for stress-testing and identify bottleneck in ETL process.}
			% \item {Established the foundation approach and model for Synthetic Patient Health Data}
			% , involving probabilistic theory of document retrieval, representation (feature) learning and deep learning. The model will not only help with generation of Synthetic Health Data, but also be implemented in filling missing patient data, predict doctor-patient encounter from health history, etc.
