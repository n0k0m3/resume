	{Jan 2022 - May 2022}
	{\begin{cvitems}
			\item {Researched, trained, and deployed scalable NER pipelines for clinical notes information extraction and de-identification using SparkNLP with PyTorch API. The pipelines saved \$2 million in annual cost comparing with third party solutions, reduced 75\% operating cost comparing with baseline model.}
			\item {Threat modeled using OWASP Threat Dragon and suggested mitigation for deployment of aforementioned pipelines and tools.}
			\item {Prototyped clinical notes annotation tool for internal use based on Label Studio and INCEpTION.}

	{May 2021 - Aug 2021}
	{\begin{cvitems}
			\item {Developed an ETL pipeline to measure data quality (completeness, conformance, and plausibility) of Truveta Health Data Model using Spark and Azure Pipelines, contributed to new partnership with Microsoft in Sept 2021. The pipeline is now part of the first Truveta's product - Truveta Studio.}
			\item {Designed a synthetic patient data model for stress-testing and identify bottleneck in ETL process, generating millions of synthetic records in 1 hour.}
			% \item {Established the foundation approach and model for Synthetic Patient Health Data}
			% , involving probabilistic theory of document retrieval, representation (feature) learning and deep learning. The model will not only help with generation of Synthetic Health Data, but also be implemented in filling missing patient data, predict doctor-patient encounter from health history, etc.
			\item {Developed an annotation recommender system for medical concept normalization. Reduced internal annotators' workload by 80\%}
			% \item {}
			\item {Assisted team members and other co-workers on various Projects and Collaborative efforts.}

	{\begin{cvitems}
			\item {Developed improved pipelines to scrape Twitter (tweets) and Reddit data (posts), reduced ingestion time by 60 times using pure bash}
			\item {Prototyped a simple model to predict suicidal tendency from social media posts, using NLP features like text statistics and TF-IDF}
			\item {Analyzed changes in monthly word statistics and wordcloud of suicidal posts over 5 years period}
