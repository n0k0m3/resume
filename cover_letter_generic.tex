    Dear Hiring Manager,
    I am writing to express my strong interest in joining your team as an AI Support Engineer. With a Ph.D. in Operations Research from Florida Tech and extensive experience in AI/ML research and development, I believe I would be a valuable asset to your organization.
    Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have honed my skills in Python, C++, and various Linux distributions, as well as big data and cloud platforms like Spark, Azure, and Kubernetes. I have a proven track record of thriving in fast-paced, collaborative environments and delivering impactful projects that align with stakeholder needs.
    Some key highlights of my experience include:
    
    Initiating and implementing an on-premise Kubernetes server cluster for the Neural Transmissions Lab at FIT
    Developing scalable Named Entity Recognition (NER) pipelines and optimizing cloud infrastructure costs during my internship at Truveta, resulting in \$2M annual savings
    Conducting cutting-edge research in satellite 3D reconstruction, suicide prevention, and deep reinforcement learning for robotics
    
    I am excited about the opportunity to bring my technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and passion for AI to your team. I believe my background in both research and industry settings has prepared me well to contribute to your organization's mission and success.
    Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to the possibility of further discussing my qualifications and how I can contribute to your team.
